# Steven Tang - Portfolio

This is my portfolio site built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site showcases dynamic features such as custom web components, data loading from both localStorage and remote JSON endpoints, and a mobile-friendly, responsive design.

## Features

- **Custom Web Components:**  
  - Implemented a `<project-card>` element using the Custom Elements API and Shadow DOM to encapsulate project details.
  
- **Dynamic Data Loading:**  
  - Projects are loaded dynamically from localStorage and a remote JSON endpoint (via JSONBin.io), enabling seamless data updates.

- **Responsive Design:**  
  - Enhanced the siteâ€™s styling using CSS media queries to ensure an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

- **Semantic Markup & Enhancements:**  
  - Improved HTML structure for better semantics and accessibility.
  - Refined CSS for a modern, clean look and improved user experience.
